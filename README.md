## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I started my IT career as an **IT systems operator with helpdesk responsibilities**, fixing printers, user accounts, and anything else people threw at me.
Eventually, I became a **Linux administrator**, where I had to learn (very quickly) everything that comes with it: automation, networking, virtualization, containers, and cloud.

My interests aren’t locked into one platform or dogma. I don’t play *Linux vs Windows vs macOS* wars — I just pick the right tool for the job.
That’s why in my repos you’ll find not only Linux-focused projects but also experiments from other corners of IT.

I like to keep a humorous twist in how I present myself, but the real goal is:
👉 **to build systems and tools that are stable, usable, and worth reusing.**

## 🧾 Certifications (a.k.a. how did I pass these?!)

- 📦 **Red Hat® Certified System Administrator (RHCSA®)** – I think I clicked the right answers?
- 📦 **Red Hat Certified Specialist in OpenShift Virtualization** – VMs inside containers inside VMs?? Sure, why not.
- ☁️ **AWS Certified SysOps Administrator – Associate** – Yes, I passed it… somehow.
- ☁️ **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner** – Cloud basics, still a mystery.
