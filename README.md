I became an admin because I was too dumb to become a programmer.  
Now I automate things I don’t understand... and call it *infrastructure as mystery*. 🤷‍♂️

Despite that, somehow I collected a bunch of certs that look impressive until you ask me what they actually mean:

### 🧾 My List of Certifications (a.k.a. how did I pass these?!)

- 📦 **Red Hat® Certified System Administrator (RHCSA®)** – I think I clicked the right answers?
- 📦 **Red Hat Certified Specialist in OpenShift Virtualization** – VMs inside containers inside VMs?? Sure, why not.
- ☁️ **AWS Certified SysOps Administrator – Associate** - yes, I passed it... somehow
- ☁️ **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner**  - cloud basics, still a mystery
- ☸️  ☸️ **KCSA, KCNA, CKA, CKAD** – I know `kubectl get pods`.
- 🔐 **HashiCorp Certified: Vault Associate (002)** (secrets, about secrets, secretly)
- 🌍 **HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate (003)** (IaC? More like WtF-as-Code)

## 🤖 What’s this GitHub account for?

This is my personal **chaos-as-code** collection:

- 🐍 **Python scripts** –  Python scripts that might work *(not yet, I’m too lazy to learn it)*
- 🧩 **Unusable Ansible roles** – *Wow, something actually exists here!*
- 🐚 **Bash scripts** – Shell commands that fix one thing and break three others *(also not yet, but the intention is strong)*
- 🛠️ **Random configs, YAMLs, and deeply cursed hacks** - Mysterious files that might summon either infrastructure or demons *(under construction... or destruction?)*

> I made it. I pushed it. I forgot it.  
> If it works, call it magic. If not, call it normal.
> Feel free to **copy**, **fork**, or just **laugh and run away**.

## 🙃 Goals?

- Keep pretending to be a sysadmin  
- Confuse future me with my own code  
- Embrace the impostor syndrome  
- Reboot routers until I feel useful  
- Fix production by breaking staging first  
- Automate things I should probably do manually

**Disclaimer:** Any resemblance to a real sysadmin is purely accidental.  
**Fun fact:** If anything here actually helps you, I’m as shocked as you are.
